ðŸŒ± Genotype-By-Sequencing (GBS)

Genotype-By-Sequencing (GBS) is a cost-effective and efficient Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol designed to discover and genotype Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in crop genomes and populations.
It is widely used in plant breeding, population genetics, and evolutionary studies.
