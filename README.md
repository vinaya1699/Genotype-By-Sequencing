**🌱 Genotype-By-Sequencing (GBS)**
```
Genotype-By-Sequencing (GBS) is a cost-effective and efficient Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol designed to discover and genotype Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in crop genomes and populations.
It is widely used in plant breeding, population genetics, and evolutionary studies.

📌 Features

    • High-throughput SNP discovery
    • Cost-efficient genotyping method
    • Suitable for large populations
    • Compatible with population structure analysis

⚙️ Setup Instructions

Download and place tools in your preferred location.

Update paths in the pipeline scripts if tools are not installed at the system/base level.
Example in scripts:

picard="/path/to/picard.jar"
gatk="/path/to/gatk"
snpEff="/path/to/snpEff.jar"
snpEff_data="/path/to/snpEff5.0/data"


**Run the pipeline as usual. The scripts will use the tools at the specified paths.**
```
```
📊 Results Generated by the Pipeline

Running the GBS automation pipeline produces the following outputs:

1️⃣ Quality Control

Raw Data QC

1_RawData/Fastqc_Output/*.html → FastQC reports for raw reads

1_RawData/Fastqc_Output/*.zip → Compressed FastQC results

Clean Data QC

2_Clean_data/Fastqc_Output/*.html → FastQC reports for cleaned reads

2_Clean_data/Fastqc_Output/*.zip

Trimming Reports

2_Clean_data/*.fastp.html → Interactive QC report (per sample)

2_Clean_data/*.fastp.json → Summary stats

2️⃣ Alignment

3_Alignment/*.bam → Aligned reads

3_Alignment/*_sorted_rdgrp_dup_marked.bam → Final BAM with duplicates marked

3_Alignment/*_dup_mark-metrics.txt → Duplicate metrics

3️⃣ Variant Calling

4_Variant_Calling/*.gvcf → GVCF files (per sample)

joint_genotyped.vcf.gz → Joint genotyped VCF (all samples)

snps_only.vcf → Extracted SNPs only

Filtered_SNP.vcf.gz → Filtered SNPs (after QUAL, DP, MAF, missingness filters)

4️⃣ Annotation

Annotated_SNP.vcf → SNPs annotated with snpEff (gene functions, impacts)

snpEFF results in html file format
